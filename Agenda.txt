# Agenda for Our Project:

1 - Using "TextLoader / UnstructuredURLLoader" Classes for Document or text Reading.
2 - Because of Token Size limit we are using Classes like "RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter" to Split the Sentences.
3 - Converting Tokens into Embeddings (OpenAI , HuggingFace , Word2Vec) etc.
4 - For Storing Vectors into DB we are using FAISS index for Semantic Search.
